  # R.O.C-Video-Dll
  
  R.O.C-Video-Dll is a C++ Dll made for windows bringing the possibility to connect
  easily an application to a set of RTSP Streams.

  It only handle the connection and the delivering of the frames in real time.
  Every bufferisation is up to the application calling the Dll.

  It is for now only able to receive h.264 encoded streams.
